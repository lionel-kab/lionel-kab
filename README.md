# Hi there! 👋

I'm Lionel Kabengwa, a passionate software developer and polyglot. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🔭 I'm constantly exploring the vast landscape of software development, always eager to learn and create innovative solutions.

💻 With a deep love for coding, I enjoy working with various programming languages and technologies. Python, JavaScript, and more - you name it, I've probably dabbled in it!

🌐 I have a strong foundation in web development, including front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React and Django.

📚 Continuous learning is my mantra. I thrive on expanding my knowledge and staying up-to-date with the latest trends, tools, and best practices in the software development world.

🌟 Beyond coding, I bring a diverse set of skills to the table. With a background of a semi-professional basketball player and French Expert, I possess excellent communication, problem-solving, and adaptability skills that enhance my ability to collaborate and tackle complex projects.
